# 🔄 Password Reset - Now Works Like Email Verification!

## ✅ What Changed

The password reset link now works **exactly like the email verification link**:

### Before ❌
- Email link pointed to: `FRONTEND_URL/reset-password?token=...`
- Needed Vercel deployment or Flutter app deep linking
- Complex setup

### After ✅
- Email link points to: `BACKEND_URL/api/auth/reset-password/{token}`
- Opens HTML page directly in browser (like email verification)
- Works immediately - no extra setup needed!

## 📧 Email Flow

### Email Verification (Already Working)
```
Email → Click Link → Opens: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/verify-email/TOKEN
                    → Shows HTML Success Page
                    → User returns to app and logs in
```

### Password Reset (Now Works the Same Way!)
```
Email → Click Link → Opens: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/reset-password/TOKEN
                    → Shows HTML Reset Form
                    → User enters new password
                    → Password updated
                    → Success message shown
                    → User returns to app and logs in
```

## 🔧 Backend Configuration

The reset link uses `BACKEND_URL` from your `.env`:

```env
BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.100.28:3000
```

**Important:** This should be your computer's IP address (not localhost) so that:
- ✅ Emails work on mobile devices
- ✅ Web browser can reach the backend
- ✅ Reset page loads properly

## 🎯 API Routes (Now Similar to Email Verification)

### Email Verification

```

### Password Reset
```

```

## 📱 What Happens When User Clicks Email Link

### 1. Email Link Clicked
```
User clicks: http://192.168.100.28:3000/api/auth/reset-password/abc123...
```

### 2. Backend Validates Token
```javascript
// Check if token exists and hasn't expired
const user = await User.findOne({
  passwordResetToken: token,
  passwordResetExpires: { $gt: Date.now() }
});
```

### 3A. Token Valid → Show Reset Form
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <!-- Beautiful password reset form -->
  <form id="resetForm">
    <input type="password" id="password" />
    <input type="password" id="confirmPassword" />
    <button>Reset Password</button>
  </form>
  
  <script>
    // JavaScript to submit form via API
    // POST to /api/auth/reset-password
  </script>
</html>
```

### 3B. Token Invalid/Expired → Show Error Page
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Link Expired</h1>
  <p>Please request a new reset link</p>
</html>
```

### 4. User Submits New Password
```javascript
// Form submits to: POST /api/auth/reset-password
{
  "token": "abc123...",
  "newPassword": "newPassword123"
}
```

### 5. Password Updated → Success Message
```html
✅ Password reset successful! 
You can now close this page and login with your new password.
```
