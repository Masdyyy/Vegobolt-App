# 🔧 ADMIN ROUTING FIX - SOLVED!

## The Problem

You logged in with the admin account (`admin@vegobolt.com` / `Admin@123`) but it was routing to the regular dashboard instead of the admin dashboard.

## Root Cause Found! ✅

The Flutter app was configured to use the **production URL** (Vercel) instead of your **local backend** (localhost:3000).

### In `lib/utils/api_config.dart`:

```dart
static const bool useProduction = true;  // ❌ This was the problem!
```

This meant:

- Your local backend has the admin account with password `Admin@123` ✅
- But the Flutter app was connecting to production server ❌
- Production server doesn't have the admin account or has different password ❌

## The Solution Applied ✅

Changed `api_config.dart` line 17:

```dart
static const bool useProduction = false;  // ✅ Now uses localhost:3000
```

Now the Flutter app will connect to your local backend where:

- ✅ Admin account exists: `admin@vegobolt.com`
- ✅ Password is correct: `Admin@123`
- ✅ `isAdmin` flag is set to `true`
- ✅ Backend returns `isAdmin: true` in login response

## Verification ✅

Tested the backend API directly:

```
✅ Login Response Status: 200
✅ Success: true
✅ Is Admin: true  ← Backend returns this correctly!
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Hot Restart Flutter App

Press `R` in the terminal where Flutter is running, or stop and restart:

```bash
cd C:\Users\johnl\LOREZO\Vegobolt-App\vegobolt
flutter run
```

### 2. Login with Admin Account

- Email: `admin@vegobolt.com`
- Password: `Admin@123`

### 3. Check Debug Output

You'll see in the console:

```
🔍 DEBUG - isAdmin value: true
🔍 DEBUG - Final isAdmin: true
✅ Routing to ADMIN dashboard
```

### 4. Expected Result

✅ You will be routed to **Admin Dashboard** (not regular dashboard)  
✅ You'll see the machine table with users/machines  
✅ You'll see the settings icon in top-right

## Why This Fix Works

### Before (Wrong):

```
Flutter App → https://vegobolt-app.vercel.app → Production DB → No admin account
                     ❌ Wrong URL
```

### After (Correct):

```
Flutter App → http://localhost:3000 → Local MongoDB → Admin account exists ✅
                    ✅ Correct URL
```

## Debug Logs Added

The login handler now includes debug output:

```dart
print('🔍 DEBUG - Login result: $result');
print('🔍 DEBUG - isAdmin value: ${result['isAdmin']}');
print('🔍 DEBUG - Final isAdmin: $isAdmin');

if (isAdmin) {
    print('✅ Routing to ADMIN dashboard');
    Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/admin-dashboard');
} else {
    print('❌ Routing to REGULAR dashboard');
    Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/dashboard');
}
```

Watch the console when you login to see which path it takes!

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/utils/api_config.dart`**

   - Changed `useProduction = true` → `useProduction = false`
   - Now connects to `localhost:3000`

2. **`lib/Pages/Login.dart`**

   - Added debug print statements
   - Shows exactly what `isAdmin` value is received
   - Shows which route is taken

3. **`vegobolt-backend/test-api-login.js`** (New)
   - Test script to verify backend response
   - Confirms backend returns `isAdmin: true` correctly

## Summary

✅ **Problem:** Flutter was connecting to wrong backend URL  
✅ **Solution:** Changed `useProduction` to `false`  
✅ **Backend Verified:** Returns `isAdmin: true` correctly  
✅ **Routing Code:** Already correct in Login.dart  
✅ **Ready to Test:** Just restart the Flutter app!
