# ‚úÖ FIXED: Network Connection Issue

## What Was Wrong:
1. **CORS was disabled** - Backend was rejecting requests from the Flutter app
2. **Server was bound to localhost only** - Couldn't accept connections from emulator

## What Was Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ **Enabled CORS** in `vegobolt-backend/src/app.js`
2. ‚úÖ **Changed server binding** from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)
3. ‚úÖ **Restarted backend server** with new configuration

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Backend running on: `http://0.0.0.0:3000`
‚úÖ CORS enabled
‚úÖ MongoDB connected
‚úÖ Ready for mobile app connections

## Now Try Again:

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Running
You should see in the terminal:
```
üöÄ Server is running on port 3000
üìç Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
üîê Auth endpoints: http://localhost:3000/api/auth
üì± Mobile access: http://10.0.2.2:3000 (Android Emulator)
MongoDB Connected: ...
```

### Step 2: Restart Your Flutter App
In the Flutter app (if it's running), try the signup/login again.

If the app is not running:
```powershell
cd vegobolt
flutter run
```

### Step 3: Test Registration
- **Name**: Yves Pogi
- **Email**: sample@yahoo.com
- **Password**: Test123 (or any password with 6+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Check "I agree to the Terms & Privacy Policy"
- Click "Create Account"

## Expected Result:
‚úÖ Should now work without "Network error"
‚úÖ You should see success message
‚úÖ Navigate to dashboard

## If Still Getting Errors:

### Option 1: Hot Reload the App
Press `r` in the terminal where Flutter is running

### Option 2: Restart the App
Press `R` (capital R) in the Flutter terminal for a full restart

### Option 3: Check Firewall
Windows Firewall might be blocking port 3000. 
- Go to Windows Defender Firewall
- Allow Node.js through the firewall

### Option 4: Use Different API URL
If Android emulator `10.0.2.2` doesn't work, get your actual IP:

```powershell
ipconfig
```

Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

Then update `vegobolt/lib/utils/api_config.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP:3000';
```

And run `flutter hot reload` or restart the app.

## Backend Logs:
When you try to register/login, you should see in the backend terminal:
```
üü¢ POST /api/auth/register
```
or
```
üü¢ POST /api/auth/login
```

This confirms the backend is receiving requests.

## Quick Test Commands:

### Test from Windows (should work):
```powershell
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Test registration from PowerShell:
```powershell
$body = @{
    email = "test@example.com"
    password = "Test123"
    displayName = "Test User"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

This should return a success response with a token if everything is working.
