# 🎯 SIMPLE TEST - After Flutter Loads

## ✅ Google Console is Configured Correctly!

I can confirm from your screenshot:
- ✅ JavaScript Origins: All added
- ✅ Redirect URIs: All added correctly
- ✅ Including: `http://localhost:52438/`

**So Google Console is NOT the problem!**

---

## 🧪 WHEN FLUTTER FINISHES LOADING:

### **Test 1: Check JavaScript Console FIRST**

1. Open the app (http://localhost:52438)
2. **Press F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Look for this message:
   ```
   [Google Sign-In] Initializing...
   [Google Sign-In] Handler ready
   ```

**If you DON'T see these messages:**
- The JavaScript in index.html didn't load
- Need to hard refresh: **Ctrl + Shift + R**

**If you DO see these messages:**
- JavaScript is loaded ✅
- Proceed to Test 2

---

### **Test 2: Try Google Sign-In**

1. Go to Login page
2. Click "Log in with Google"
3. **Check what happens:**

**Scenario A: Page redirects to Google**
- ✅ **GOOD!** This means redirect flow is working
- Select your account
- Wait for redirect back
- Should login

**Scenario B: Popup opens**
- ❌ **BAD!** Still using old popup method
- Means the code changes didn't take effect
- Need to verify index.html was updated

**Scenario C: Nothing happens**
- Check console for errors
- Type this in console:
  ```javascript
  window.googleSignInWeb
  ```
- Should show an object with `signIn` and `handleRedirect` methods

---

### **Test 3: If Redirect Happens**

After redirecting to Google and coming back, check console for:
```
[Main] Detected Google OAuth redirect
[Google Sign-In] Processing redirect with access token
[AuthService] Got user data from redirect: your@email.com
```

---

## 🆘 Quick Diagnostics

### **In Browser Console, type:**

```javascript
// Check if handler exists
console.log('Handler exists:', window.googleSignInWeb ? 'YES' : 'NO');

// Check if we have a redirect result
console.log('Has redirect:', window.location.hash.includes('access_token'));

// Test initialization
window.googleSignInWeb?.init().then(() => console.log('Init OK'));
```

---

## 📋 What Should Happen (Success Flow)

1. **Load app** → Console shows: `[Google Sign-In] Handler ready`
2. **Click button** → Page redirects to Google (full page, not popup!)
3. **Select account** → Google redirects back
4. **App loads** → Console shows: `[Main] Detected Google OAuth redirect`
5. **Process token** → Console shows: `[AuthService] Got user data from redirect`
6. **Navigate** → Goes to Dashboard
7. **✅ SUCCESS!**

---

## ❌ What Should NOT Happen

1. ❌ Popup window opening
2. ❌ `popup_closed` error
3. ❌ Error 404 on Google
4. ❌ `redirect_uri_mismatch` error

---

## 🔍 Most Likely Issues (If Still Fails)

### **1. JavaScript Not Loaded**
**Symptom:** No console messages from [Google Sign-In]
**Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### **2. Still Using Old Code**
**Symptom:** Popup opens instead of redirect
**Fix:** Check if index.html has `ux_mode: 'redirect'`

### **3. Backend Not Running**
**Symptom:** Token processed but login fails
**Fix:** Check backend is on port 3000

## ⏱️ Wait for Flutter to Finish...

The terminal shows Flutter is building. When you see:
```
✓ Built build\web\main.dart.js
```

Then Edge will open automatically.

**THEN do the tests above!** 🧪

**Let's see what happens with this clean build!** 🚀
